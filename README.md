<h1 align="center">My Experiences: </h1>

- Project 1 MovieReview, from fontend to backed was developed by me

  - Worked on fontend with pretty usuall way
  - Developed fully working backend with Django
  - Used Celery and redis for task queues
  - Used Mysql as db

- Project 2 Chitty App
    
    It is a mobile app that manages Onam chitty.
    
    - I made backend using Django and DjangoRestFramework.
    - Allmost every bit of the code which I written for backed has its Unit test. So, it is much easyer to scale.
    - App is Developed in react-native and used a lot of its third-party libraries
